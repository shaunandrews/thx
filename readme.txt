== Description ==

Making it easier (and better!) to browse and manage your themes in WordPress. Most of this doesn't work yet.

== Installation ==

Install this plugin just like any normal WordPress plugin, by dropping the folder into your wp-content/plugins/ folder. Once you activate the plugin you'll see the new "Themes Prototype" item under the Appearance menu.
